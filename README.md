ML Final Project: Comparison of LSTMs and Markov Models for Text Generation

Our code is largely based off of the following:

LSTM:<br/>

Markov Model:<br/>

In this project, we are comparing the following models:<br/>

1st order Markov Model<br/>
2nd order Markov Model<br/>
Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)<br/>
Hidden Markov Model (HMM) + LSTM

The performance metrics we are comparing are training time, testing time, and accuracy for each model.
