ML Final Project: Comparison of LSTMs and Markov Models for Text Generation

Our code is largely based off of the following:

LSTM:

Markov Model:

In this project, we are comparing the following models:

1st order Markov Model
2nd order Markov Model
Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)
Hidden Markov Model (HMM) + LSTM

The performance metrics we are comparing are training time, testing time, and accuracy for each model.
